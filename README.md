# Vehicle-License-plates-Detection
This project builds a fully machine-learning-free system that detects vehicle license plates in still images using only classical computer vision and image processing techniques. The goal is to locate the plate region reliably across common driving conditions without relying on trained models, datasets, or deep learning.
